I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, reflecting a robust academic foundation. My research journey has been dedicated to enhancing computational performance across varied domains, including Bioinformatics, ISP Censorship, Social Networks, and Deep Learning Algorithms, particularly with large datasets. As a former Software Engineer at Enosis Solutions, I gained practical industry experience. Presently, I contribute to academia as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at United International University, fostering a new generation of tech enthusiasts. Eager to deepen my expertise, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. opportunity in Computer Architecture and High-Performance Computing Systems for Fall 2023. My research aspirations focus on advancing computation in the realms of Deep Learning and Computer Security, aiming to make significant contributions to these evolving research domains.
